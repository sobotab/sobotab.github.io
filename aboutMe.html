		<h2>Bio</h2>
		<p>Hi, my name is Ben. I'm from Southern Delaware and I study Computer Science at the university of Delaware. I am a Junior, but I plan on graduating in the Spring of 2022. During the summer time I spend most of my time at the beach lifeguarding. I'm either doing medicals, rescuing people, enforcing rules, or riding waves. While I'm at school I'm either studying, hanging out with friends, or working out.
		<h2>Hobbies</h2>
